There is no Jupyter Notebook template this week. 
You may need to use "pack and trim" the general fitting routine, and/or the 1-parameter or 2-parameter linear fits to analyze your data from Experiment 07.
To prepare for the lab, read through the instructions, and prepare a skeleton template, including any code blocks you foresee needing.
