Two example notebooks are provided here for performing linear fits with 1 free parameter (slope) or 2 free parameters (slope + intercept).
For this week's assignment, you will use/adapt the code in these example notebooks to further analyze the data you collected in Experiments 02 and 03.
There is no template notebook this week; you will create your own, making sure you follow the best practices we have been developing.
